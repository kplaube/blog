# klauslaube.com.br

The implementation of my [blog](https://klauslaube.com.br), powered by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

The blog is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The project structure is quite simple:

- **content:** All the articles
- **src:** The source code. Written with Gatsby/React
- **static:** Static resources (like `robots.txt`)

# Installing

Make sure you have Node.js >= 11.

The `install` task will resolve the dependencies like Gatsby, React, Styled Components, etc.

```
npm install
```

To run the development server:

```
npm start
```

And to deploy:

```
npm run deploy
```

Contributions are very welcome!
